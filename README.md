# Shortest-Path-Finder

This is the Application for calculating the shortest path for particular source and multiple destinations in the
city using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm.

There is a 13 node Graph. ( Find the "Graph.png" )

Details of the Graphs are stored in 3 files.
    Graph.dat
    Vertex.dat
    VertexList.dat
    
Example:

According to Graph Source and Destinations are:

Source: Airport

Destinations:
SEAS
RailwayStation
LawGarden

Then the Ouput will be:
Airport----->RailwayStation
RailwayStation----->GitaMandir----->LawGarden
LawGarden----->SEAS
