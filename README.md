# Shortest-Path-Finder

This is the Application for calculating the shortest path for particular source and multiple destinations in the
city using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. This project was in the course "Data Structures and Algorithms".

There is a 13 node Graph. ( Find the "Graph.png" )

Details of the Graphs are stored in 3 files.
    
    Graph.dat
    Vertex.dat
    VertexList.dat
    
Example:

According to Graph Source and Destinations are:

Source: 

    Airport

Destinations:
    
    SEAS
    RailwayStation
    LawGarden

Then the Ouput will be:
   
    Airport----->RailwayStation
    RailwayStation----->GitaMandir----->LawGarden
    LawGarden----->SEAS
So, This is the shortest route for covering these destinations from source

How to Run:

1. If you want to calculate shortest path for source and multiple destinations then select "User" mode when you run the file.

2. If you want to create your own graph then select "Developer" mode when you run the file.
